      <div class="question">5.How do I keep my cryptocurrency safe?</div>
      <div class="answer">Don't be a thief of your own wallet! NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS.
        The safest way to store your airdrops are hardware & cold storage wallets.
        These wallets store your coins offline, and therefore protect them from being hacked. There are a number of hardware wallets available. We would advise to use the Ledger Wallet Nano S or Trezor.
        Not all cryptocurrency can be stored in hardware wallets. We advise you to store your crypto in wallets where you control your private keys. You don't want your free crypto to be stolen!.</div>
